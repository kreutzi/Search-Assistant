    <h2>What is a Search Aggregator?</h2>
    <p>
      A search aggregator is a powerful tool that collects and combines search
      results from multiple sources into a single, unified interface. Instead of
      visiting various websites or using different search engines, a search
      aggregator does the heavy lifting for you, bringing diverse information
      together in one place.
    </p>
    <p>Key benefits of search aggregators include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Time-saving: Retrieve information from multiple sources simultaneously
      </li>
      <li>
        Comprehensive results: Access a wider range of data and perspectives
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved relevance: Often employ algorithms to rank and filter results
      </li>
      <li>
        Customization: Many allow users to tailor sources and result preferences
      </li>

    <h2>How GemAssist Uses the Gemini API</h2>
    <p>The Gemini API is at the heart of GemAssist's capabilities:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Query Analysis:</strong> When you enter a search query, Gemini
        API analyzes it to understand the context, intent, and key elements of
        your request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Source Selection:</strong> Based on the query analysis,
        GemAssist determines the most relevant sources to search.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Parallel Searching:</strong> GemAssist performs searches across
        multiple sources simultaneously, leveraging Gemini's efficient
        processing capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Result Aggregation:</strong> Search results are collected and
        processed by the Gemini API, which identifies common themes, removes
        duplicates, and ranks information by relevance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Summarization:</strong> For complex queries, Gemini can generate
        concise summaries of the aggregated information, highlighting key points
        and insights.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Response Generation:</strong> Finally, GemAssist formulates a
        clear, coherent response to your query, combining direct answers,
        summaries, and links to further information as appropriate.
      </li>
    </ol>
